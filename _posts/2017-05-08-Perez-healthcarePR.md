In Puerto Rico, the amount paid in medical expenses for health care premiums in 2013, was
divided into groups: private insurance and federal employees. However, for the purposes of this study
the private insurance is of particular importance because of the exorbitant amount of money paid.

In 2013, there was a significant difference in medical payment between the
private group plan and the individual. One insurer, Triple-S Salud, paid an annual $603, 436, 481 in group insurance
and on an individual basis, $96, 359, 658.  The question is what are private groups, and are they specific to companies,
or larger corporations, or small businesses. Also, the amount paid for an individual is incredibly high, is that insurance
provided by their employer, or do they have to purchase it? Overall question, what provisions does group or individual have?

The objective in the use of this data is to tell the difference between license type and the type of insurance plan that comes
with that license. Here we can see which insurance company has a private plan, and what type of license they are required to
solicit. Some insurers, according to the data have requested licenses from domestic and foreign insurers. And, in looking at the
numbers, foreign insurance license for private groups pay less, than those acquired through a domestic license.

In the postman breakdown, I was able to group the insurance companies by private and non-private groups. This made it easier
to decipher among the data, which insurance companies only worked under privacy restrictions. See below for postman analysis.
