Champaign is a city in the state of Illinois with a population of 208, 419
in 2016. In this dataset, I found the crime rates for Champaign from
2007 – 2011. I wanted to focus on a smaller location, to see how often the data
was updated. Typically, I have seen larger cities update their data more
frequently, either because of population size or other stricter state
requirements. This specific dataset was last updated December 5, 2012. The
results are divided by offense and then by year. Although a final number is
given for each offense, the total is not; it is only for violent crimes.

My first instinct was to input the number (in average per year) of when the
crimes were committed most by year. Then, I was going to include a break-down
of the year with the highest average. However, that was difficult because the
average was not able to be split in this dataset, and if it did, it would have
been by incident, but that isn’t known. The offenses range from murder one
and two, sexual assault, robbery, battery-aggravated, vehicular hijacking,
and total violent crimes. When putting together the pivot table, I broke down
the list by offense, then created a sum of all the years. In completing this
portion, I could see that there was a decline in violent crime from
2007 – 2009, but in 2010, the numbers rose by 376, and then took a dive in
2011 by 538.

When looking at the [chart](https://docs.google.com/a/u.northwestern.edu/spreadsheets/d/1wFVwx9OcxP8ErYQnJnn3V3cahctYAUj16bKh9vB6rn0/edit?usp=sharing), we can see that the numbers vary at the beginning of
2007 – 2009, but nothing too significant. Although, when looking at the next
two years, we can certainly see the changes there, as the numbers jump and
decrease dramatically. In the chart, the numbers and their steady increase is
reflective, but I continue to question what the numbers are based on. Why was
crime higher in 2010 than in 2009 or 2011? What factors contributed to this,
and how was the data collected. Those were some of the issues I initially had
when sorting through the details, and how someone may be able to go through the
data; years and sum of total is not a complete analysis of how things work.
